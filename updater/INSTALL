To install the scripts you will need to set up apache directory for cgi-bi and html files
(usually it would be /var/www or $HOME/public_html)
Pass this dir as a parameter to installation script during interactive setup:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

(To reconfigure run ./Build reconfig)
